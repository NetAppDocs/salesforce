== Backup policies
SaaS Backup for Salesforce has three predefined tiers of backup policies.  These policy tiers vary in backup frequency and data retention period.  Production Instances can only be protected by the tier 1 policy.  Sandbox Instances can be protected by the tier 2 and tier 3 policies.

Backup policies with an *Active* status are polices to which items have been assigned for backup.  Backup polices with an *Inactive* status do not have items assigned for backup.
