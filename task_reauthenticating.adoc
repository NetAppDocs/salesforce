Salesforce allows usage of a maximum of 5 tokens before you must reauthenticate your credentials.  If you attempt to initiate a backup or restore and all your tokens have been used, you receive the following error message: “expired access/refresh token”.  If you receive this message, you must reauthenticate before proceeding.
