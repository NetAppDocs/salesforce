You can purge data from Salesforce organizations. Purging your data at the organization level is managed in *Account Settings*.

Metadata retention and purges are automatically managed by SaaS Backup for Salesforce. Metadata is retained for 90 days. After 90 days, the metadata is purged.

== Purging Data
You always have the option to purge data from a specific organization such as an unused Salesforce organization.

You can purge data to refresh from production to sandbox instances.

You may also want to add another sandbox. To do so, you must purge another sandbox instance.
